# ALPA: Taming the Tail  
This repository contains the implementation of the paper **"Taming the Tail: Leveraging Asymmetric Loss and Padé Approximation to Overcome Medical Image Long-Tailed Class Imbalance"**. The code addresses challenges in medical imaging caused by long-tailed class distributions, introducing an innovative approach based on asymmetric loss functions and Padé approximations to improve classification performance on imbalanced datasets.

---

## Features
- **Asymmetric Loss (AL)**: Reduces the impact of over-represented classes while improving performance for under-represented ones.
- **Padé Approximation**: Enhances numerical stability for gradient computation, addressing the skewness of class distributions.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Supports robust evaluation across multiple folds.
- **Scalable Design**: Supports ConvNeXt and other backbones for experiments with configurable parameters.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/alpa.git
   cd alpa
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure GPU compatibility with PyTorch:
   ```bash
   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.x -c pytorch -c nvidia
   ```

## Training
To train the model with ALPA, use the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py \
    --is_master=1 \
    --train=1 \
    --gpu_ids="cuda:3" \
    --criterion="Pade" \
    --seed=0 \
    --model=convnext \
    --batchsize=128 \
    --epochs=50 \
    --img_size=256 \
    --model_path="result" \
    --save_model=1 \
    --store_name="_kfold"
```

### Key Arguments:
- `--is_master`: Specifies if the process is the main training process (1 for master).
- `--train`: Set to 1 to enable training mode.
- `--gpu_ids`: Specify the GPU(s) for training (e.g., `"cuda:0"`).
- `--criterion`: Set to `"Pade"` for the Padé Approximation loss.
- `--seed`: Random seed for reproducibility.
- `--model`: Backbone model for training (e.g., `convnext`).
- `--batchsize`: Batch size for training.
- `--epochs`: Total number of epochs.
- `--img_size`: Input image resolution (e.g., 256x256).
- `--model_path`: Path to save the trained model.
- `--save_model`: Set to 1 to save the best-performing model.
- `--store_name`: Suffix for the model filename to track experiments.

## Evaluation
You can evaluate the trained model by using a validation dataset and configuring the arguments accordingly. Replace `--train=1` with `--train=0` to enable evaluation mode.
